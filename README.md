# PATH 548L

Welcome to the software page for UBC Pathology 548L.

## Software

We will cover the use of two different software packages for statistical analysis in this course.

### GitHub Desktop

Course material related to statistical analysis will be distributed from this git repository.
If you are new to git we suggest downloading the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download) which is available for Mac and Windows.

### JASP

[JASP](https://jasp-stats.org) is an open source and free software package.
It provides a graphical interface for doing statistical analyses.
It supports the majority of analyses we will perform in this course.
However, it lacks some flexibility that the other approach of using Python provides.

You can download JASP from [here](https://jasp-stats.org/download).

### Python

We will also be introducing how to do statistical analysis using [Python](https://www.python.org).
Python is a general purpose programming language.
While not specifically designed for statistics, a number of packages have been developed that support a large range of analyses.
While slightly more complex to learn than graphical methods such as JASP, doing analyses in Python can be more flexible.

The setup for Python is a bit more complicate than JASP, as we will need several packages in addition to the Python language itself.
The reccomended approach is to download the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download) which will provide most of what we need in this course.
